            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark,
                    a businessman and engineer who runs the company Stark Industries.
                    Beginning his career as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone,
                    and his heart is severely injured by Shrapnel. To sustain his heart and escape
                    his captors, he builds a technologically advanced armor. After escaping, he
                    continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that
                    grant him superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities.
                    The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories
                    were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil
                    unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and
                    governmental authority.</p>
